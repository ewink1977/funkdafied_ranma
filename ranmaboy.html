                                Ranma is the main character of the story. I am certain that you were able to figure that out by the simple fact that the name of the show is Ranma ½. Some people may yell at me about making a separate page for his boy side and girl side, but I don't care what ANYONE says. Ranma does have two personalities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                His boy personality and his girl one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are some traits that are evident in his boy side and girl side, but there are some traits that aren't. The engagement chart should have taught you who Ranma is engaged to, so I won't bother you with those details here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ranma was raised primarily by his father out and about on training missions. He hasn't had a lot of interaction with his mother, nor much social interaction with many other kids. This has produced someone who can be difficult to deal with at times. Ranma tends to lack, well, tact. Now, it's not necessarily a bad quality to say what's on your mind, but Ranma needs to learn that there are bad times.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I like Ranma. He would be a good friend to have. He's very loyal. You don't get to see him in any interaction with his friends in the anime, with the exception of the Tendos. Based on the way he acts around them you can come to the conclusion that if you were in trouble, he'd do his best to help you out. Ranma in his male form is also pretty mellow. I'll discuss this more in detail on the female side page.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My favorite Ranma characteristic is the fact he is in SO MUCH DENIAL about his feeling for Akane. I think he may need to start a 12-step program in Akane's Anonymous. The first step is admitting you have the love jones, son.

                        <p>I'm Ranma Saotome. Age 16.</p>
                        <p>Erin's done a good job talking about me. Up until the Akane part. I have no feelings for her what so ever. My dad took me away on a training voyage when I was very young. Thanks to him I am engaged to three girls. Well, actually four, but I defeated one in martial arts take out and got the engagement ended.</p>
                        <p>I practice Anything Goes Martial Arts. Founded by the freak, it's a free-style grappling based art with specialization in mid-air combat.</p>
                        <p>I currently attend high school with Akane, Nabiki and Ukyou.</p>
