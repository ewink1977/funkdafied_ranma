                                Ranma is the main character of the story. I am certain that you were able to figure that out by the simple fact that the name of the show is Ranma ½. Some people may yell at me about making a separate page for his boy side and girl side, but I don't care what ANYONE says. Ranma does have two personalities. His boy personality and his girl one. There are some traits that are evident in his boy side and girl side, but there are some traits that aren't. The engagement chart should have taught you who Ranma is engaged to, so I won't bother you with those details here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Man oh man alive I absolutely love girl Ranma. She is such a trip to watch. The greatest irony of the Ranma saga is that when she is a girl and she calls Akane a tomboy. Who's more of a tomboy?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Girl Ranma is so different than boy Ranma in several ways. First, girl-type Ranma is so much moodier. Guess that's just an overall female trait. (Guess we know who's going to die single!) She complains constantly that she hates being a girl, but she will not hesitate to use her girl form to her advantage. (What? Free ice cream?) I also think she's more sensitive in her girl form. Maybe another female-in-general trait.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Man, it wasn’t till I recoded this that I realized how damn misogynistic I 'used' to be...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She can be as tactless, but I think she realizes that the things she says are hurtful better when she's female. Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. By the way, I love the images I used. They really show parts of Ranma's personality that you don't see when he's male. Top, she's very happy, bottom, sad. Male Ranma doesn't allow his emotions to show.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Except for anger. It's a shame too.
                            </p>

                        <p>I'm Ranma Saotome. Age 16.</p>
                        <p>Well, I would agree with Erin again on this one if he hadn't thrown cold water on me just to do this segment.</p>
                        <p>This female body is a curse and that is how I treat it. I may use it as a tactical advantage, but I can tell you I would not turn down an opportunity to rid myself of it. 
                        It should be evident in the many times that I have tried to find a cure.</p>
                        <p>And by the way, I would appreciate it if you would pick different pictures to use on this page before you upload it. These I don't think are very good.
                        Though then again, they are better than the ones Nabiki tried to sell you... Okay, these are fine.</p>
