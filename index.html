                            <p>Many years ago a man named <a href="genma.html">Genma Saotome</a> had relations with his wife. They had a son. Across town, a man named <a href="soun.html">Soun Tendo</a> had relations with his wife. They had a daughter. If you need further information on this, call your parents or do a Google search for ‘rule 34’.</p>
                            <p>Don’t actually do that search.</p>
                            <p>Anyway, after all of this getting it on, Genma and Soun decided that their children would marry each other in order to continue the Anything Goes School Of Martial Arts, the school that they ran, founded by their master, Happosai.</p>
                            <p>While Genma and his son Ranma were in China on an ill-conceived training trip, the pair fell into cursed ponds. Ranma fell in Spring of Drowned Girl, and Genma fell into Spring of Drowned Panda. Now when splashed with cold water, they turn into a girl and panda, respectively. Hot water reverses this effect.</p>
                            <p>Yada, yada, yada, welcome to Ranma ½. If you need more explanation than this, let me know. I'll talk to you about it. Better yet, check out Ranma ½ in 10 Minutes.</p>

                            <p>This website is a fun little project I started back in 1996 or so as <span class="italics">ewink's groovy Ranma ½ and Sailor Moon Page</span>. Eventually, I realized Sailor Moon was far too complex for my laziness to maintain and I made it a Ranma exclusive page.</p>
                            <p>It’s pretty much been in archive mode for the past fifteen years or so, but I recently decided to change things around and make the site more responsive to mobile users. I am also going through a coding bootcamp right now, so I figured changing the site up would be good practice.</p>
                            <p>Anyway, please enjoy the site. Bounce around, there’s character information, an engagement chart that used to be cool, miscellaneous information, and some fan fiction links!
